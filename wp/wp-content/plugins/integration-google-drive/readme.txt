### Data Privacy

When you use the built-in app to authenticate and link your Google Drive account, the Application collects the following information:

[Privacy Policy](https://codeconfig.dev/integration-google-drive-privacy-policy/) 

This data is collected only after you grant access via the Google OAuth consent screen. Upon consent, you’ll be redirected through the CodeConfig server **[https://codeconfig.dev/?authorization=integration-google-drive](https://codeconfig.dev/?authorization=integration-google-drive)**, which then redirects you back to your site to complete the authorization.
'apps.googleusercontent.com' uses this domain for the Google authorization process. It will include the App and Client ID. 

== External Services ==

This plugin connects to the **Google Drive API** services to enable integration with your Google Drive account.  
It allows the plugin to upload, view, edit, and manage files directly from your Google Drive, providing seamless synchronization and document management.

=== What data is sent and when ===
- When you authorize the plugin, it requests permission (OAuth 2.0) to access your Google Drive files.  
- The plugin sends authentication tokens and API requests to the Google Drive API endpoints (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/`) when you perform actions such as uploading, fetching, or editing files. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` is using the API scopes. 
- No data is shared with any third-party services other than Google.  
- The plugin does not store or transmit sensitive user data beyond what is required for Google Drive access and file operations.

=== Why this data is sent ===
The data exchange is necessary to:
- Retrieve and display Google Drive file lists.
- Upload and manage files within Google Drive.
- Display embedded documents such as Google Sheets or Docs in your WordPress admin or site content.
